## Welcome to a GitHub Page for JRAEBROWN.com

It's going to change. With every commit, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the site based on the content of my Markdown files.
You don't need to know any of that, so this is more a note for myself in case I get distracted by something shiny and forget what I was doing.

Oh look! 

### Squirrel!

Anyway, here's some more informative placeholder text. Something more exciting will replace it soon enough...

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jraebrown/jraebrown.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
